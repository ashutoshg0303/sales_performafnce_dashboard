# Sales Performance Dashboard – Tableau Project

### Overview
This project was developed as part of my **Data Analyst Internship at HCL**. It focuses on analyzing and visualizing sales data using **Tableau**, providing business insights on total revenue, product performance, and customer behavior across different cities and categories.

The dashboard is fully interactive, allowing users to filter data by city, product line, and more. It includes dynamic KPIs and visualizations designed to support strategic decision-making in sales performance management.
